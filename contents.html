                        <p> Photographie sous diasec (125 x 125cm)</p>
                        <p>The artist starts from a simple principle: the walk.

                                <p> He uses this action in order to "lose himself" in nature and then makes an "arrangement" through an installation of which he then makes a photographic observation. Nils Udo uses different techniques: photography, drawing, painting, installation, sculpture with natural elements. Mixing ephemeral sculpture, precarious installation and large format photography, Nils-Udo’s works are produced in and with nature. Weathering and natural decay are an integral part of his creative process.

                        <p> Ronan Bouroullec's drawings follow the idea of the so-called intuitive drawing.

                                <p> This technique allows him to develop new images and to reach the subconscious layers of the mind. Intuitive drawing is derived from the literary roots of surrealism and its automatic writing, which requires that the consciousness be completely extinguished while writing a text. This literary form has in turn influenced the content of many works by Surrealist artists and often results in meanders and flowing forms.

Sekou is also a member of Quincy Jones’ “A Team” along with session musicians such as John "JR" Robinson, Greg Phillinganes and Paul Jackson, Jr.
